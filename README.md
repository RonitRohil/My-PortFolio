# My Portfolio

Personal finance SPA for tracking bank accounts, transactions, investments, loans, recurring rules, and stock mappings across devices.

This project now uses Supabase as the primary backend, with `localStorage` only kept for offline buffering, migration support, and local stock-name mappings.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- a Supabase project

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

Do not commit real keys.

### Supabase Schema

Run the SQL in:

- [supabase/schema.sql](./supabase/schema.sql)

This creates the required tables, RLS policies, and indexes.

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Other Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Authentication

- Supabase email/password auth is used
- this is a single-owner app
- no public sign-up flow is required

The owner account should be created in Supabase Auth ahead of time.

## Data Model Overview

The main app shape is `PortfolioData` in:

- [src/types.ts](./src/types.ts)

Main domains:

- `bankAccounts`
- `income`
- `expenses`
- `transfers`
- `investments`
- `loans`
- `recurringRules`
- `settings`

## Key Files

  app shell and page routing
- [src/hooks/useAppData.ts](./src/hooks/useAppData.ts)
  main state and persistence hook
- [src/lib/dataService.ts](./src/lib/dataService.ts)

## Deployment

The app is set up for GitHub Pages deployment.

If using GitHub Actions, add these repository secrets:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Notes

- Net worth should remain separate from monthly cash flow.
- SIP and RD auto-generated expenses depend on schedule data and linked source accounts.
- Stock mapping is an important workflow because broker exports often name the same stock differently.
- If synced data looks wrong, check both Supabase env vars and whether the latest SQL has been applied.
